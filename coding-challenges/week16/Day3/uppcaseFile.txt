A MOTHER’S WISDOM

BY LORI ARMSTRONG, KELSEYVILLE, CALIFORNIA

I HAVE ALWAYS WORN MY CHILDREN’S BIRTHSTONES AROUND MY NECK. ONE MORNING, WHEN I WAS LATE FOR WORK, MY INFANT SON LARRY’S TOPAZ BIRTHSTONE FELL FROM MY GOLD CHAIN. I FRANTICALLY SEARCHED FOR IT, WHISPERING TO MYSELF, “I LOST MY LARRY, BUT I WILL GET HIM BACK.”

THAT DAY, LARRY’S CARDIOLOGIST CALLED WITH TEST RESULTS FROM ONE OF HIS FIRST CHECKUPS. HE WOULD NEED EMERGENCY HEART SURGERY. HAPPILY, THE OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS, AND I WHISPERED IN LARRY’S EAR, “I THOUGHT I LOST YOU, BUT I KNEW I’D GET YOU BACK.”
